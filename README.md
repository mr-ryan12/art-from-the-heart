## Abstract

*Tired of pretending to like ugly art in museums? We are too.*

Art From The Heart is a web application that allows users to overcome internal and external biases to answer the only question that matters: Do I like this work of art? 

The homepage greets a user with categories of art pulled directly from the Art Institute of Chicago. Upon clicking a category, a random work of art will be displayed for a user to rate up or down. Only after they rate the work of art will the details about the author, creation date, description of the work, etc. be shown to the user. This allows people to view and enjoy art without the implications of certain biases being forced upon them such as those that from classism/elitism. After they have rated the art they can then choose to see another art piece from that category or they can choose to go home and select another category.

## Future Goals

Create a backend to allow:
- Tracking of user votes over time
- The ability to leave and see comments for each work of art
- Allow users to upload their own works of art so other users will never know if they are rating museum art or personal art
